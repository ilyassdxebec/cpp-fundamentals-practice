# Strengthening Fundamentals — C++, Algorithms & DSA

Using C++ as the vehicle to build a strong foundation in programming fundamentals, low-level concepts, algorithms, data structures, clean code practices, and problem solving skills — progressing from simple to advanced.

---

## 📚 What This Covers

- **C++ Core Concepts** — syntax, memory, pointers, references, OOP
- **Low-Level Programming** — memory management, bitwise operations, pointers
- **Algorithms** — sorting, searching, recursion, dynamic programming
- **Data Structures** — arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs
- **Clean Code** — naming conventions, structure, readability, best practices
- **Problem Solving** — exercises and challenges at every level

## 🧩 Topics Breakdown

### 🟢 Beginner
- Variables, data types, operators
- Control flow — loops, conditionals
- Functions, default parameters, overloading
- Arrays and 2D arrays
- Pointers and references
- Recursion basics

### 🟡 Intermediate
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Dynamic memory allocation
- STL — vectors, maps, sets
- Sorting & searching algorithms
- String manipulation
- Writing readable and maintainable code

### 🔴 Advanced
- Algorithm complexity (Big O)
- Advanced recursion & backtracking
- Dynamic programming
- Linked lists, stacks, queues
- Trees — BST, AVL, heaps
- Graphs — BFS, DFS, shortest path
- Hash tables

---

## 🧠 Problem Solving Approach

- Break problems down before writing a single line of code
- Think in edge cases — zeros, negatives, empty inputs
- Optimize only after it works correctly first
- Write clean, readable solutions over clever ones

---

## ✅ Clean Code Principles Followed

- Meaningful and consistent naming conventions
- Functions do one thing only
- No dead code or unnecessary comments
- Code that explains itself without needing documentation

---

## 🛠 Tools & Environment

- **Language:** C++17
- **IDE:** Visual Studio / VS Code
- **Compiler:** g++ / MSVC

---

## 🎯 Goal

Build a rock-solid foundation in computer science fundamentals using C++ — concepts that carry over into any language, framework, or system down the road.
